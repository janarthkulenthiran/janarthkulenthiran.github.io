                  <p class="anim">The image above represents the overall plan of the Flappy bird project. By starting from the top left,
                        three electrode leads will be connected from the forearm muscles to an instrumentation amplifier incorporating
                        a circuit for common mode rejection. The signal will then be band-pass filtered in accordance with EMG signal
                        bandwidth. Since the EMG signal is not rhythmic in nature, typical signal processing usually consists in
                        rectification and integration. A comparator with hysteresis will then compare the integrator
                        output to a threshold before triggering a monostable circuit that will send a pulse through an
                        optoisolator to relay that will activate the left button of the mouse which will enable the user to play a game
                        of Flappy Bird.</p>

                        which makes the signal less responsive and clear.
